        A home page is generally the main web page a visitor navigating to a
        website from a search engine will see, and it may also serve as a
        landing page to attract visitors.[1][2] The home page is used to
        facilitate navigation to other pages on the site by providing links to
        prioritized and recent articles and pages, and possibly a search box.[3]
        For example, a news website may present headlines and first paragraphs
        of top stories, with links to full articles.[4] Meanwhile, other
        websites use the home page to attract users to create an account. Once
        they are logged in, the home page may be redirected to their profile
        page. This may in turn be referred to as the "personal home page".[5]
