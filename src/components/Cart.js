        A cart page is an essential part of an e-commerce website. It is the
        page where users can pile up what they want to buy from the website and
        then simply checkout by paying online. To comprehend what a cart page
        does, think of it as a normal shopping cart in a store. People can keep
        adding whatever they want to buy in the shopping cart, and later, check
        out at the counter. Similar is the case with a cart page, only that the
        shopping is done online on an e-commerce website.
